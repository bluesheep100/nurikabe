# Nurikabe

## What is nurikabe?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_(puzzle)):
> Nurikabe (hiragana: ぬりかべ) is a binary determination puzzle named for Nurikabe, an invisible wall in Japanese folklore that blocks roads and delays foot travel. Nurikabe was apparently invented and named by Nikoli; other names (and attempts at localization) for the puzzle include Cell Structure and Islands in the Stream.

This project is an attempt at creating a playable version of a Nurikabe puzzle, which can also generate random (though not necessarily solvable) puzzles of user-defined dimensions. VueJS is the primary tool of choice for this purpose. Not for any particular reason, save for being a frontend component-based framework, and personal preference.


## Known Issues
- Currently no limit on grid size. Browser freezes for ~45 seconds at 500x500
- Numbers don't appear on the grid when generated, for some reason.
